[`Intl.Segmenter`][intl.segmenter] utils based on [ICU4X]

Will become useless as soon as Firefox enables `Intl.Segmenter` in stable versions ([Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1423593)).

**upd:** Firefox 125 [comes][ff125-rel-notes] with `Intl.Segmenter` enabled, but it's still young (April 2024).
